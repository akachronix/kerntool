# kerntool
## Description
This is a work-in-progress project that uses the files the unc0ver jailbreak drops to give you information about various things like the kernel slide.

## TODO
 - Parse ```offsets.plist``` and make it more readable
 - Split code across files
 - Put entire build chain in the ```Makefile``` as soon as I figure out how ```theos``` works
 - Add a summary feature
 - Implement support for reading ```Substrate``` and crash logs
